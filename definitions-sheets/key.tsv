This makes it ideal for a variety of dishes, including pilafs, salads, stir-fries, and side dishes. In terms of cooking methods, long grain brown rice requires a longer cooking time compared to white rice due to its bran and germ content. It typically needs to be simmered or boiled for around 45-50 minutes, or until it reaches a tender consistency. Using the correct ratio of water to rice is crucial to ensure optimal results.

It is a good source of complex carbohydrates, which provide sustained energy and help regulate blood sugar levels. The dietary fiber found in long grain brown rice aids in digestion, promotes satiety, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Additionally, it contains minerals such as magnesium, phosphorus, and selenium, as well as vitamins like B vitamins and vitamin E. Overall, long grain brown rice is a versatile and nutritious grain option that can enhance the flavor and nutritional profile of various dishes. Its unique texture, nutty taste, and health benefits make it a popular choice among those seeking a wholesome and satisfying addition to their meals. Being classified as a BrownRiceFoodProduct, it is a healthy alternative and a staple in many cuisines worldwide.	887	0.0					BrownRiceFoodProduct		False	LongGrainBrownRice_uncooked_				[{'predicate': 'subClassOf', 'target': 'BrownRiceFoodProduct'}]		FOODON:00004374		0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0	0	1	0	definition	background	gpt-3.5-turbo	long grain brown rice (uncooked)				A type of uncooked rice that falls under the category of BrownRiceFoodProduct.

mondo	syndromic genetic obesity	A specific type of obesity that is caused by genetic factors and presents with a syndromic phenotype.

Individuals with this condition display a set of characteristic symptoms and physical features that are associated with a specific syndrome. These symptoms and features can vary greatly among individuals, but often include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, dysmorphic facial features, and various other medical issues. Syndromic genetic obesity is also classified as a subclass of syndromic diseases, which are a group of disorders characterized by a combination of signs and symptoms that occur together and are associated with a specific genetic cause. Another subclass that syndromic genetic obesity falls under is overgrowth obesity syndrome. This implies that individuals with syndromic genetic obesity often experience excessive growth, resulting in a higher-than-average body weight.

mondo	46,XX disorder of sex development induced by androgens excess	46,XX disorder of sex development induced by androgens excess refers to a group of rare, genetic disorders of sex development where exposure to excessive levels of androgens leads to masculinization (virilization) of the external genitalia in phenotypically normal female individuals. This results in varying degrees of undervirilization and/or ambiguity of external genitalia, ranging from clitoromegaly to partial and complete fusion forming a urogenital sinus, penoscrotal hypospadias and/or labioscrotal fusion.

obi	functional assessment of individual	The functional assessment of individual relationships refers to a specific type of assessment that falls under the category of Physical Examination Of An Organism. This assessment involves the evaluation and analysis of the functional capabilities and dynamics of relationships between individuals.  In this context, relationships can pertain to various domains such as family, friends, romantic partners, colleagues, or any other significant connections between individuals. The assessment aims to understand how these relationships function in terms of communication, support, cooperation, and overall well-being.  The functional assessment of individual relationships typically involves examining both quantitative and qualitative aspects. This includes assessing the frequency and quality of interactions, the level of emotional and psychological support provided, the ability to resolve conflicts, and the overall satisfaction and happiness within the relationship.  Professionals who specialize in conducting functional assessments of individual relationships may use different methods and techniques to gather relevant information. These can include interviews, questionnaires, observations, psychological tests, and analyzing any available documentation or records.  The assessment process usually begins with establishing a clear understanding of the individuals involved and their specific roles within the relationship. The assessor may examine the internal dynamics within the relationship, identifying any potential strengths, weaknesses, or areas for improvement.  During the assessment, the assessor may also consider external factors that can influence the functionality of the relationship. This can include cultural, societal, or environmental factors that may impact communication patterns, expectations, and norms within the relationship.  Once the assessment is complete, the assessor can provide valuable insights and recommendations for enhancing the functional aspects of the relationship. This can involve suggesting strategies for improving communication skills, conflict resolution techniques, or identifying areas where additional support or resources may be needed.  The functional assessment of individual relationships is valuable in a variety of settings. It can be particularly helpful in therapeutic settings, such as couples counseling or family therapy, where identifying and addressing relationship dynamics is essential for positive outcomes.  Overall, the functional assessment of individual relationships offers a comprehensive evaluation of the functioning and dynamics within relationships. By examining various aspects of the relationship, professionals can provide guidance and support to help individuals enhance their interpersonal connections and overall well-being.	2297	0.0					PhysicalExaminationOfAnOrganism		False	FunctionalAssessmentOfIndividual				[{'predicate': 'subClassOf', 'target': 'PhysicalExaminationOfAnOrganism'}]		OBI:0003501		0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0	0	1	1	definition	background	gpt-3.5-turbo	functional assessment of individual			A physical examination of an individual's ability to perform functional activities.
