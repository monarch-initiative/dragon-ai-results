cl	chorionic girdle cell	The chorionic girdle cell is a specialized cell type that originates from the trophoblast layer of the developing embryo. It is found in the placenta and plays a crucial role in the formation and functioning of the chorionic girdle, a circular structure that surrounds the embryonic disc. These cells share many characteristics and functions with other trophoblast cells and are responsible for implantation, placenta formation, and nutrient exchange between the mother and the developing fetus. They have a flattened shape, form a continuous layer surrounding the embryonic disc, and participate in nutrient absorption and transport. Chorionic girdle cells also play a role in the production of hormones essential for pregnancy, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Overall, these cells contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the placental barrier while facilitating the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products.	428					ChorionicTrophoblastCell	
cl	enteroglial cell	Glial cell that provides support to the enteric nervous system. It is involved in enteric neurotransmission, in maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier of the gut and serves as a link between the nervous and immune systems of the gut. In enteric nerve strands, glial processes ensheath multiaxonal bundles which distinguishes enteric glia from all other peripheral glia. Ultrastructurally, the most conspicuous trait of an enteroglial cell is the presence of 10 nm filaments, which criss-cross the cell body, form axial bundles in the processes and appear to firmly anchor the cells to the ganglionic surfaces. Similar to astrocytes, their main constituent is glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).	430					GlialCell	{'predicate': 'PartOf', 'target': 'EntericNervousSystem'} | {'predicate': 'Expresses', 'target': 'GlialFibrillaryAcidicProtein'}

This assessment involves the evaluation and analysis of the functional capabilities and dynamics of relationships between individuals.

In this context, relationships can pertain to various domains such as family, friends, romantic partners, colleagues, or any other significant connections between individuals. The assessment aims to understand how these relationships function in terms of communication, support, cooperation, and overall well-being.

The functional assessment of individual relationships typically involves examining both quantitative and qualitative aspects. This includes assessing the frequency and quality of interactions, the level of emotional and psychological support provided, the ability to resolve conflicts, and the overall satisfaction and happiness within the relationship.

Professionals who specialize in conducting functional assessments of individual relationships may use different methods and techniques to gather relevant information. These can include interviews, questionnaires, observations, psychological tests, and analyzing any available documentation or records.

The assessment process usually begins with establishing a clear understanding of the individuals involved and their specific roles within the relationship. The assessor may examine the internal dynamics within the relationship, identifying any potential strengths, weaknesses, or areas for improvement.

During the assessment, the assessor may also consider external factors that can influence the functionality of the relationship. This can include cultural, societal, or environmental factors that may impact communication patterns, expectations, and norms within the relationship.

Once the assessment is complete, the assessor can provide valuable insights and recommendations for enhancing the functional aspects of the relationship. This can involve suggesting strategies for improving communication skills, conflict resolution techniques, or identifying areas where additional support or resources may be needed.

The functional assessment of individual relationships is valuable in a variety of settings. It can be particularly helpful in therapeutic settings, such as couples counseling or family therapy, where identifying and addressing relationship dynamics is essential for positive outcomes.

Overall, the functional assessment of individual relationships offers a comprehensive evaluation of the functioning and dynamics within relationships. By examining various aspects of the relationship, professionals can provide guidance and support to help individuals enhance their interpersonal connections and overall well-being."	2482					PhysicalExaminationOfAnOrganism

A bronchopulmonary segment exhibits a pyramidal shape, with its apex pointing towards the center of the lung and its base toward the pleural surface. It is a part of the lobe of lung.	3193					OrganSubunit | EndodermDerivedStructure	{'predicate': 'PartOf', 'target': 'LobeOfLung'} | {'predicate': 'ContributesToMorphologyOf', 'target': 'LobeOfLung'}
uberon	bronchopulmonary segment	A distinct anatomical structure that is an organ subunit and is derived from the endoderm. It is part of and contributes to the morphology of the lobe of the lung.	3194					OrganSubunit | EndodermDerivedStructure	{'predicate': 'PartOf', 'target': 'LobeOfLung'} | {'predicate': 'ContributesToMorphologyOf', 'target': 'LobeOfLung'}
uberon	bronchopulmonary segment	A functionally independent subdivision of a lobe of the lung, originating from the endoderm during embryonic development, that contributes to the morphology of the lobe of the lung.	3195					OrganSubunit | EndodermDerivedStructure	{'predicate': 'PartOf', 'target': 'LobeOfLung'} | {'predicate': 'ContributesToMorphologyOf', 'target': 'LobeOfLung'}
