PerturbationBySymbiontOfHostActinCytoskeletonViaFilamentousActinDepolymerization	perturbation by symbiont of host actin cytoskeleton via filamentous actin depolymerization	The process in which an organism effects a change that impairs the structure or function of the host actin cytoskeleton by depolymerizing the host filamentous actin. The host is defined as the larger of the organisms involved in a symbiotic interaction.		[{'predicate': 'subClassOf', 'target': 'PerturbationBySymbiontOfHostActinCytoskeleton'}]		GO:0141030	The process in which an organism effects a change in the host actin cytoskeleton by depolymerizing filamentous actin.

CoTranscriptionalRNA3_endProcessing_cleavageAndPolyadenylationPathway	co-transcriptional RNA 3'-end processing, cleavage and polyadenylation pathway	Any process involved in transcription termination-coupled  3' processing of RNA polymerase II RNA transcripts by 3' end cleavage  and addition of a poly(A) tail. This pathway is required for the maturation of primary protein-encoding transcripts into functional RNAs that can be exported from the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm, but is also required for polyadenylation-dependent decay.

RibosomeHibernation	ribosome hibernation	A cellular process that results in the silencing of ribosomes in quiescent cells. Quiescence takes place when cells encounter unfavorable conditions and cease to grow in bacteria and yeast. It also takes place in some specialized cells in higher eukaryotes, such as eggs. Ribosomes in a hibernation state are kept silent via association with proteins with inhibitory and protective functions.
