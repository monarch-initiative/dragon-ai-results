The defect arises due to a germline mutation in the GNE gene, initially present in a person's germ cells and can be inherited by the offspring. It is a subclass of protein defects in neuromuscular diseases impairing muscle functions either directly or indirectly.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0	0	1	0

HemifacialMicrosomia	hemifacial microsomia			[{'predicate': 'subClassOf', 'target': 'OculoAuriculoVertebralSpectrum'}]		MONDO:0015398	A congenital disorder characterized by underdevelopment of the ear and jaw one side of the face. It is a subtype of Oculo-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum, indicating disorders characterized by abnormal development of the ear, eye, and vertebra. Manifestations may include a missing or underdeveloped ear, absence of the external ear canal resulting in conductive hearing loss, atypical facial appearance, small and undeveloped mandible, or a soft palate cleft. Associated health problems may include difficulties with eating or breathing, dental problems, or problems in the spinal column or kidneys. Degree of asymmetry varies among individuals. The cause is not known but may be associated with blood flow issues during early pregnancy.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0	0	1	0
46XYDisorderOfSexDevelopmentDueToIsolated1720LyaseDeficiency	46,XY disorder of sex development due to isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency	46,XY disorder of sex development due to isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency is a rare disorder of sex development due to reduced 17,20-lyase activity that affects individuals with 46,XY karyotype and is characterized by ambiguous external genitalia, including micropenis, perineal hypospadias, bifid scrotum, cryptorchidism, and a blind vaginal pouch. Blood pressure and electrolytes are normal whilst hormonal investigations show normal basal and stimulated levels of cortisol, and low basal and stimulated androgen levels.		[{'predicate': 'subClassOf', 'target': 'CongenitalAdrenalHyperplasiaDueTo17AlphaHydroxylaseDeficiency'}]		MONDO:0019597	A rare hormonal disorder affecting the normal process of sexual development due to the body's inability to produce specific hormones. It's characterized by a deficiency in the 17,20-lyase enzyme, leading to symptoms such as high blood pressure, low levels of potassium in the blood, and irregular sexual development. In males, it might lead to underdevelopment of the male genital tissues, while females might suffer from amenorrhea and infertility.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0	0	1	1
