ChorionicGirdleCell	chorionic girdle cell	A horse-specific, highly invasive trophoblast cell that invades the endometrium where it forms endometrial cups.		[{'predicate': 'subClassOf', 'target': 'ChorionicTrophoblastCell'}]		CL:4040001	The chorionic girdle cell is a specialized cell type that originates from the trophoblast layer of the developing embryo. It is found in the placenta and plays a crucial role in the formation and functioning of the chorionic girdle, a circular structure that surrounds the embryonic disc. These cells share many characteristics and functions with other trophoblast cells and are responsible for implantation, placenta formation, and nutrient exchange between the mother and the developing fetus. They have a flattened shape, form a continuous layer surrounding the embryonic disc, and participate in nutrient absorption and transport. Chorionic girdle cells also play a role in the production of hormones essential for pregnancy, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Overall, these cells contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the placental barrier while facilitating the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0	0	1	1
