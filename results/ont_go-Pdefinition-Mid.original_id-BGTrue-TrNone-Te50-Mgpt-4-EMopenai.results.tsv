[{'predicate': 'subClassOf', 'target': 'DisruptionOfAnatomicalStructureInAnotherOrganism'}]		GO:0141062	A phenomenon where the normal structure or function of tissue in one organism is unsettled or disturbed by actions originating from a different organism. This disruption could be physiological, physical, or chemical, and is usually the result of an invasive process by the initiating organism. The term can be applied in contexts of parasitism, pathogenesis, and the study of environmental impacts on ecosystems.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0	0	1	1
EggDeposition	egg deposition	The multicellular organismal reproductive process that results in the movement of an egg from within an organism into the external environment.

This process usually involves the transfer of eggs from the female organism where they are produced to an external environment or to another organism. It is a subclass of multicellular organismal reproductive process and plays a critical role in the propagation and survival of these species.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0	0	1	1
PerturbationBySymbiontOfHostActinCytoskeletonViaFilamentousActinDepolymerization	perturbation by symbiont of host actin cytoskeleton via filamentous actin depolymerization	The process in which an organism effects a change that impairs the structure or function of the host actin cytoskeleton by depolymerizing the host filamentous actin.

RibosomeHibernation	ribosome hibernation	A cellular process that results in the silencing of ribosomes in quiescent cells. Quiescence takes place when cells encounter unfavorable conditions and cease to grow in bacteria and yeast. It also takes place in some specialized cells in higher eukaryotes, such as eggs. Ribosomes in a hibernation state are kept silent via association with proteins with inhibitory and protective functions.		[{'predicate': 'subClassOf', 'target': 'NegativeRegulationOfRibosomeBiogenesis'}]		GO:0141014	A biological phenomenon that refers to the state of dormancy or inactivity of ribosomes in a cell under certain conditions, such as unfavorable temperatures, nutrient limitations, antibiotics exposure, and various other stresses. During hibernation, the ribosomes halt protein synthesis and undergo structural changes to form inactive complexes, thus conserving energy and reducing metabolic activities. Misregulation or disruption of this process can potentially contribute to diseases like cancer, where accelerated ribosome biogenesis is a key feature.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0	0	1	1
